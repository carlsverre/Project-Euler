PROBLEM
-------
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples
of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

SOLUTION
--------
Prepare a list with all the multiples of 3 below 1000
Prepare a list with all the multiples of 5 below 1000, but
filter out everything that divides by 3

Sum each list and then sum the sums.
