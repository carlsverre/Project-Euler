Problem:
========
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Solution:
---------
+ Start at 999*999 and work down from there
+ Put it in a string and compare
+ Generate batches of 100 numbers
+ Sort the batches!

My final solution is a bit longer than it could be, but it runs very very fast.
